In this project, I will be recreating the Google search results page, utilizing HTML and CSS. This will be a leap back into coding for me, as I started a few months ago and life just got in the way.

I will try my best to update progress in here, make notes of what I've learned and need to improve, and just use this as a sort of "journal" throughout the process.
